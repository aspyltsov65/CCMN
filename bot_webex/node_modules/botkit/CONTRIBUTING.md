## Submitting Pull Requests

* Pull requests should contain a concise topic and detailed accompanying text that clearly identifies both the purpose and justification for acceptance of any changes.
* Create, or link to an existing issue identifying the need driving your PR request. The issue can contain more details of the need for the PR as well as host debate as to which course of action the PR will take that will most serve the common good.

## Styleguides

### General Code

* End files with a newline.
* Place requires in the following order:
  * Built in Node Modules (such as `path`)
  * Local Modules (using relative paths)
* Avoid platform-dependent code:
  * Use `path.join()` to concatenate filenames.
* Using a plain `return` when returning explicitly at the end of a function.
  * Not `return null`, `return undefined`, `null`, or `undefined`

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally
